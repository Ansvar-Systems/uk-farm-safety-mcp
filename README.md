UK farm health and safety guidance via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). Query HSE machinery safety, livestock handling rules, COSHH substance requirements, children on farms regulations, RIDDOR reporting, and risk assessment templates -- all from your AI assistant.

Part of [Ansvar Open Agriculture](https://ansvar.eu/open-agriculture).

## Why This Exists

Farming is the most dangerous industry in the UK. HSE publishes safety guidance across dozens of web pages, PDFs, and information sheets. This MCP server puts it all in a queryable database so AI assistants can give accurate, sourced answers about farm safety obligations.

## Quick Start

### Claude Desktop

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "uk-farm-safety": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@ansvar/uk-farm-safety-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add uk-farm-safety npx @ansvar/uk-farm-safety-mcp
```

### Streamable HTTP (remote)

```
https://mcp.ansvar.eu/uk-farm-safety/mcp
```

### Docker (self-hosted)

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/ansvar-systems/uk-farm-safety-mcp:latest
```

### npm (stdio)

```bash
npx @ansvar/uk-farm-safety-mcp
```

## Example Queries

Ask your AI assistant:

- "What safety measures are needed for tractor PTO work?"
- "Can a 14-year-old drive a tractor on a farm?"
- "What PPE is needed for sheep dipping?"
- "What incidents must I report under RIDDOR on a farm?"
- "Give me a risk assessment template for cattle handling"
- "What are the COSHH requirements for pesticide storage?"
